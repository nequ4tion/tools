# toolz
In this repository I'll store some random tools that might be of use to other people.

## the toolz:

# linuxstandby
A SETUID binary that sends linux to sleep.

C version:
`make linuxstandby-c`

Rust version (for when your want to be very careful with SETUID binaries):
`make linuxstandby-rust`
